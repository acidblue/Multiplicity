Multiplicity perl Script for making multiple copies of a file.
Should work for Windows and Linux
Been tested on Win XP and Ubuntu 10.10

Just do>> perl -w name_of_script.pl
in a termianl window and follow the screen prompts.

I am currently working on a GUI version using Perl/Tk
but that is in early alpha and not ready for prime time.
